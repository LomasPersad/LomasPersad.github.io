                    The Bhagavad Gita, one of the most revered Hindu texts,
                    delves into the essence of our existence, the cosmos, and
                    our connection with the divine. As a guiding light for life,
                    it provides invaluable insights into our place in this vast
                    universe. This sacred manuscript unfolds its teachings
                    through a spiritual dialogue between Shri Krishna and his
                    devoted disciple Arjuna, set amidst the backdrop of a
                    momentous war. By convincing Arjuna to fulfill his duty on
                    the battlefield, the Lord transforms his emotional turmoil
                    into unwavering focus and righteous action. Written in the
                    melodious language of Sanskrit, the Bhagavad Gita embraces
                    an extensive vocabulary that masterfully conveys the
                    spiritual concepts it elucidates. As the language through
                    which the divine words were spoken, Sanskrit also finds its
                    remarkable utility in the realm of computer languages,

                    At its core lies the science of knowing the absolute truth,
                    Brahma Vidyā, a revelation that has captivated countless
                    scholars, philosophers, eminent physicists, celebrities, and
                    truth-seekers alike. Before this magnificent scripture, we

                  Lord Krishna said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, what you say
                  is correct; the mind is indeed very difficult to restrain. But
                  by practice and detachment, it can be controlled.You have the
                  right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not
                  entitled to the fruits of your actions.
